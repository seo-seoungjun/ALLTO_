                    <h2>ALLTO IS MADE FOR ALL</h2>
                    <p>It all started with three people having a cup of coffee together on Tuesday afternoon
                        in a small cafe in Seoul, <br class="br">
                        a day so ordinary that it seemed just right to start an adventure. <br class="br">
                        The trio were each interested in different areas, had strong characteristics of their own, <br class="br">
                        but were able to meet by sharing the common dream of putting effort <br class="br">
                        for a world where everyone could be the core of change.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Knowing that the world will not change in a split second, they decided to meet the ones <br class="br">
                        who were busily innovating the world at this moment. Individuals, organizations, and startups.
                        <br class="br">
                        They listened to their ambitious vision, surprisingly creative solutions, and their concerns.
                        <br class="br">
                        The three agreed, that this is not a place for those problems to stick, blocking the way <br class="br"> 
                        of fulfilling the future that startups were venturing towards to.
                    </p>

                    <br>
                    <p>
                        So, one on business strategy and branding, the other on UI/UX design, the another on Interactive
                        development, <br class="br">
                        they dived in to providing solutions for the ones who were cultivating the better future as the
                        core of change.
